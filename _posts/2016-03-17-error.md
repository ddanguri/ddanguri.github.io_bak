## Windows Git Bash에서 bower init Error

Windows에서 [bower](http://bower.io/)를 설치하고 bower init을 통해 bower.json을 생성하려고 하니 아래와 같은 error가 발생하였다. Windows에 Git Bash를 사용하였는데 [이와 같은 문제가 발생한 사람이 많은듯 하다.](https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/2080)

```
bower init
bower ENOINT        Register requires an interactive shell

Additional error details:
Note that you can manually force an interactive shell with --config.interactive
```

위 에러가 떠서 **PowerShell**을 띄워서 bower init 했더니 잘 먹힌다.

```
bower init
? name t_to_p
? description
? main file index.js
? what types of modules does this package expose? node
? keywords
? authors
? license ISC
? homepage
? set currently installed components as dependencies? Yes
? add commonly ignored files to ignore list? Yes
? would you like to mark this package as private which prevents it from being accidentally published to the registry? (y? would you like to mark this package as private which prevents it from being accidentally published to the registry? Yes

{
 name: 't_to_p',
 description: '',
 main: 'index.js',
 license: 'ISC',
 moduleType: [
   'node'
 ],
 homepage: '',
 private: true,
 ignore: [
   '**/.*',
   'node_modules',
   'bower_components',
   'test',
   'tests'
 ]
}

? Looks good? Yes
```

> The problem seems to be with the terminal/console you're using to.
I ran into the same problem today, I was using the Git bash as my terminal, and trying to run the command through the Node.js command prompt worked normally.
Try to run the command through another terminal, like the Node.js command prompt, the Windows cmd itself or another (I'm still looking for another command prompt solution besides cmd that looks like the Git bash). Hope to have helped you. Best wishes!
