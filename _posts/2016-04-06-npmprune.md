***The Problem: npm ERR! extraneous***

Checking out an npm problem, I tried
```Command
$ npm list
```
and got the following error at the end of my listing:

```Command
npm ERR! extraneous: fsevents@0.1.6 /Users/flichten/repos/cg/feature-library/feature-skeleton/node_modules/karma/node_modules/chokidar/node_modules/fsevents
npm ERR! extraneous: recursive-readdir@0.0.2 /Users/flichten/repos/cg/feature-library/feature-skeleton/node_modules/karma/node_modules/chokidar/node_modules/recursive-readdir
npm ERR! not ok code 0
```

**The Explanation: Unneeded (“extraneous”) packages are installed**

It seems the problem is really just a warning. NPM is saying that there are some unused, unnecessary packages installed. In most cases, this is probably an “error” that should be a warning and can therefore be ignored.

**The Solution: npm prune**

It’s probably safe to ignore this error. But you can clean up the unnecessary packages with

```Command
$ npm prune
```

Problem solved.
